        <li>He wrote a BASIC interpreter, that was bundeled with the majority of Home computers from the mid 1970's, through to the mid 1980's, and got the world coding. </li>

<li>Later he bought and enhanced 86-DOS, and sold it for IBM PC's, as MS-DOS; later bundeled with a copy of some compression software he forgot to licence.</li>

<li>He worked with IBM on developing OS/2, and made a few pennies selling a cut down, less functional and resource hungry version, under the trade name Microsoft Windows (Swapping the text and graphics origins, and messing with the API names, though legally, does not a new OS make).</li>

<li>He bought a few Office application companies, and created a suite of programs known as Microsoft Office, to kill off Lotus 123, WordPerfect....</li>

<li>He created a rather easy to use set of Development tools, that became Visual Studio, encouraging developers to churn out app's for his OS.</li>

<li>He licenced Mosaic to create a free web browser that would kill of a growing company that was selling it's own under the name Netscape, after initially dismissing the Web as a fad.</li>
